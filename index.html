<p>Understanding users on the web and modeling their interests is important for two tasks: (1) customizing users' experience on the web; and (2) reducing information overload. To determine user interests various user generated content has been analyzed, for example, Google harness users' search history and click behavior for ranking search results, and  Amazon leverages users' browsing and shopping history for recommending new items. While diverse information about users is available, the introduction and popularity of social media platforms, where users create significant content, has provided new opportunities to analyze data for understanding users. However, processing social media data introduces its own challenges such as noisy, informal text, and lack of semantic context due to its short-text nature. Addressing such  challenges to model users online is the goal of this project, which also forms the core of my dissertation.     
</p><p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hierarchical Interest Graphs:</span> This work introduces a novel representation of user interests as a hierarchy termed as hierarchical interest graph. Interests are determined from users' social media posts and the hierarchical representation is inferred from Wikipedia hierarchy. The wikipedia hierarchy create for this work has been utilized by more than 5 research labs world wide. While a user study demostrates the quality of hierarchical interest graphs, we also prototyped a recommendation system that harnesses the hierarchical interest graph for recommending tweets to users. Our approach outperforms the existing techniques for content-based recommendation systems such as SVM and LDA. </li> 
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Home Location Prediction of Social Media users:</span> Location of a social media user adds value to various applications  such as demographic based recommendation, and disaster management. However, only 4% of users on Twitter share their geographic information. Existing techniques are supervised and requires time intensive process of creating training data for each location to be predicted which also makes it harder for the techniques to adapt to new locations. To address these challenges, this work introduces a novel, knowledge-base driven, unsupervised methodology for predicting user home location.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Determining User Activities of Interest:</span> Mundane activities (hobbies) such as running, watching football, and hiking that users share on social media can enhance exising recommendation systems. Existing techniques for extracting activities from social media data focus on extracting major events, ignoring mundane activities of users. In this work, we built a probabilistic model for determining user activities of interest from social data. The approach also maps the determined  activities to Wikipedia concepts to enable the use of background knowledge associated with the concepts.</li>

<p>Infrastructure systems are a cornerstone of civilization. Damage to infrastructure from natural disasters such as an earthquake (e.g. Haiti, Japan), a hurricane (e.g. Katrina, Sandy) or a flood (e.g. Kashmir floods) can lead to significant economic loss and societal suffering. Human coordination and information exchange are at the center of damage control. This project seeks to radically reform decision support systems for managing rapidly changing disaster situations by the integrated exploitation of social, physical and hazard modeling capabilities.
</p><p>
I play the role of the lead co-ordinator for the project. I am contributing to design novel, multi-dimensional cross-modal aggregation and inference methods to compensate for the uneven coverage of sensing modalities across an affected region. I am also working on using machine learning with knowledge base driven techniques to continuously adapt the filters for crawling social data relevant to dynamically evolving events. Preliminary evaluation shows that our technique can improve the recall of the tweets being streamed by maintaining good precision relevant to the event of interest

Social media has had unprecedented growth in the recent times. This gives opportunity to decision makers– from
corporate analysts to coordinators during emergencies, to answer questions or take actions related to a broad variety of activities and situations: who should they really engage with, how to prioritize posts for actions in the voluminous data stream, what are the needs and who are the resource providers in emergency event, how is corporate brand performing, and does the customer support adequately serve the needs while managing corporate reputation etc. We demonstrate these capabilities using Twitris+ by multi-faceted anlaysis along dimensions of Spatio-Temporal-Thematic (STT), People-Content-Network (PCN), and Subjectivity: Emotion-Sentiment-Intent (ESI). Twitris’ diversity and depth of analysis is unprecedented. </p><p>
My work in this project involved porting the Twarql infrastructure to Twitris and allowing complex querying to
answer interesting questions on Twitter data. The complex query answering enables SPARQL queries with DBpedia
as the background knowledge on event relevant tweets.

<p> Twitter has become a prominent medium to share opinions, observations and suggestions in real-time. Insights
from these microposts (”Wisdom of the Crowd”) has proved to be invaluable for businesses and researchers around the world. However, the microblog data published is increasing in numbers with the popularity and growth of Twitter. This has induced challenges in filtering these microblog data to cater the needs for aggregation and collective analysis for sense-making. Twarql addresses these challenges by leveraging Semantic Web technologies to enable a flexible query language for filtering microblog posts. </p><p>
I was involved in designing and developing end to end Twarql system. The system includes (1) a pipeline of
information extraction techniques on tweets to extract metadata, (2) an annotation module to transform the raw
metadata to RDF, and (3) a flexible filtering and broadcasting component for users. Technologies used include Java, Storm, RDF, SPARQL, Hadoop, and PIG. We published two papers with one winning the Triplification challenge in
2010.

<p> Users of traditional microblogging platforms such as Twitter face drawbacks in terms of (1) Privacy of status updates as a followee -- reaching undesired people (2) Information overload as a follower -- receiving uninteresting microposts from followees. In this project we have implemented a privacy-aware version of google's PuSH protocol (Semantic Hub) for distributed and user-controlled dissemination of microposts using SMOB (semantic microblogging framework). The approach leverages users' Social Graph to dynamically create group of followers who are eligible to receive micropost. The restrictions to create the groups are provided by the followee based on the hastags in the micropost. Both SMOB and Semantic Hub are available as open source
